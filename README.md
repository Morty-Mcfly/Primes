# Primes
IsPrime function created in C/C++
No practical application for this, just wanted to learn how to use DLLs in python, as well as create them on my own. Just an exercise, and as such, it uses some 'borrowed' code (IsPrime function)

# Using it

Just open it in Visual Studio, click build, and out comes a DLL

Open the python file in your IDE of choice (I prefer VS Code), and run it

It simply checks to see how much faster C++ is than Python
